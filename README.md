## Description
Trackly is a full-stack social media SPA for music enthusiastists:
- Search for an artist's albums
- Create a profile
- Review albums
- Favourite albums
- Display your favourite albums on your profile
- Comment on reviews
  
The MVP for Trackly was developed as part of my final project for fulfillment of my MSc in Software Development.

Trackly's current state is the MVP and future iterations would offer features such as concert tracking and music recommendations.
